    <h1><a name="Cal-monthly-plugin-documentation"></a>Documentation for the
      California Monthly plugin</h1>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="about-the-plugin"></a>About the Plugin</h2>
    <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">California Monthly</span> plugin
      provides automatic monthly adjustment of irrigation times based on
      historical weather data. It is intended as an aid for water conservation.</p>
    <p>This plugin adjusts the run times for all scheduled irrigation programs
      by a percentage which is calculated from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Monthly
        Average Reference Evapotranspiration by ETo Zone</span> table found on
      page 3 of the linked PDF document.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" title="ETo Document" href="http://wwwcimis.water.ca.gov/Content/pdf/CimisRefEvapZones.pdf">http://wwwcimis.water.ca.gov/Content/pdf/CimisRefEvapZones.pdf</a></p>
    <p>Reference ETo is an estimate of the amount of water removed from the soil
      by <span style="font-weight: bold;">evaporation</span> from the soil
      surface and by plants (<span style="font-weight: bold;">transpiration</span>)
      in units of inches using a standard type of plant. You can think of the
      ETo value as the amount of rain (in inches) it would take to replace the
      water that has been removed.</p>
    <p>The calculation divides the average ETo for each month by the maximum ETo
      value for the selected zone.</p>
    <p>ETo / Maximum ETo * 100 (rounded to a whole percentage) </p>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="using-the-proto-plugin"></a>Using the
      California Monthly plugin</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Click the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">FIND YOUR ETO ZONE</span>"
        button. A new tab will open in your browser with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">REFRENCE
          EVAPOTRANSPIRATION ZONES</span> document loaded.</li>
      <li>Scroll down to the zone map on page 2 and find the zone for your
        location.</li>
      <li>Enter your zone number in the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">ETo
          Zone</span>" box.</li>
      <li>Click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">CALCULATE</span>". The monthly
        adjustments will appear as percentages of scheduled watering times. <br>
        You may optionally change the percentages manually but it is recommended
        to keep the calculated values and make changes to your irrigation
        schedules to suit your local conditions.</li>
      <li>Click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">SUBMIT</span>" at the bottom
        of the page to save your settings and return to the home page.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:<br>
    The month with the highest ETo value will appear with an adjustment of 100%
    This is the month with the highest water use on average. Adjusting your
    irrigation schedules during this month to provide adequate water to your
    plants should give you a good base line for the rest of the year. However,
    it is always wise to remain vigilant for changes in conditions.<br>
